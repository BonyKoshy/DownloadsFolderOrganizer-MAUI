## Origin Story

Downloads Folder Organizer started out as a lightweight Python + Tkinter desktop utility, born out of frustration with cluttered Downloads folders.

That first version was quick, intuitive, and did the job beautifully — offering auto-categorization, undo support, and even a dark mode toggle. You can still check out that original project here:

But the ambition was always bigger. The goal? A native-feeling, modern, and more scalable utility that blends seamlessly with Windows' Fluent design and delivers a richer, smoother UX.
